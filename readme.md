## Aruodas Scraper

This Python script uses Selenium web automation library to scrape apartment data from the en.aruodas.lt website. The data is stored in a CSV file named apartments.csv.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- webdriver-manager

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file apartment_scraper.py
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located
3. Run the command python apartment_scraper.py
4. Follow the prompt to enter the number of apartments you want to scrape
5. The script will automatically scrape the data and store it in the apartments.csv file
- **Note**: The script uses a random wait time between actions to make it look like human activity. This is to avoid getting blocked by the website.
